# os-scheduling
Process Scheduling: implement a simulated process scheduler that can use round-robin, shortest-job-first, first-come-first-serve, and preemptive priorty scheduling algorithms to run a configuration file that characterizes a set of prcesses that needs to be run. 

This program also prints out the final statistics of the scheduler including: 
* cpu utilization
* throughput 
* waiting time 
* turnaround time
